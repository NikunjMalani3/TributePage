    <h1 class="start-writeup">Points to Ponder (More Awesome Content is Coming Very
        Soon)</h1>
    <h2>Why <strong>I LOVE ICE</strong></h2>

    <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-point">The Constant engagement while driving, the feel to having a perfect shift, perfect
            clutch relase, constant
            enthu of having all control by myself, the endless smile when you rev a motor till its limit, the fun, the
            constant space of mind required with three pedals, the perfect calibration required every time you brake or
            accelarate or do anything, the always room for improvement, breaking parts learning
            new things everyday, the local check-up we do now and then to see if everthing is ok or not.</li>
        <li>There Automobile are not just a machine for some people ther are as close as a human being, people treat
            them with almost care as a living being, family memeber. It also works as a stress buster for some people,
            just to detach from all the battels they are facing everyday.</li>
        <li>Learn regarding automobile, practice if possible its like a love-hate relationship where when you brake
            something you hate it but when you repair it you love it.</li>
        <li>The most love affection you give to your automobile the more you smile, admire, feel happy about it while
            driving, standing watching it.</li>
